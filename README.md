An admin panel is a web-based interface that allows administrators to manage and control various aspects of a website, application, or system. It typically includes tools for user management, content moderation, data analytics, system settings, and performance monitoring. The panel provides secure access to backend functions, enabling authorized users to efficiently oversee operations and make updates without needing direct access to the code.
